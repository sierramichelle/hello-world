Hi there!

Today, I'd like to talk about one of my childhood favorite T.V. channels, *Nickelodeon*!

One Nickelodeon show came out in 1998, and though I was born in 1999, I watched it a lot as a kid. It wasn't my all time favorite show, but my uncle watched it **a lot** while babysitting me, so naturally, I grew up loving it.
*CatDog* follows a cat and a dog attatched to each other. Dog is seen as sort of dumb while Cat masterminds a lot of their antics and how to resolve their issues, of which there are many.
