Hey @manicsparkle

I'd like to talk about one of my childhood favorite T.V. channels, *Nickelodeon*!

One Nickelodeon show came out in 1998, and though I was born in 1999, I watched it a lot as a kid. It wasn't my all time favorite show, but my uncle watched it **a lot** while babysitting me, so naturally, I grew up loving it.
*CatDog* follows a cat and a dog attatched to each other. Dog is seen as sort of dumb while Cat masterminds a lot of their antics and how to resolve their issues, of which there are many. 
As Winslow T. Oddfellow once said:
>Hey Einstein, you makin' a flyin' machine or just a racket?

Another show I often binged was *Hey Arnold!* This was about a fourth grader living in an urban area and figuring out how to help his friends. It often showed how difficult some kids may have it and how you should always be nice to them.

*Blue's Clues* was by far my all time favorite. It followed a blue dog that left pawprints on things she wanted Steve to find. Once he found all of the clues, we would figure out what Blue wanted to do that day.
I still remember the day Steve went off to college and left his brother Josh behind to watch over Blue. I was heartbroken and I think that's about the time I stopped watching the show.:cry: Blue's Clues was one of my \*all time\* favorites because of how interactive it was.

All in all I think my list of these favorites would have to look like
1. Blue's Clues :blue_heart:
2. CatDog
3. Hey Arnold!

A more general list of other shows I liked around this time include
* Spongebob Squarepants
* Jimmy Neutron
* The Fairly OddParents
* Danny Phantom
